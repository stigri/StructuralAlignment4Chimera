apt-get install python-dev

to build libraries and tools in static mode, type 

   make
   
the same in dynamic mode, type 
  
   make MODE=dynam
   
   
   please check if struct_pwa can finde all it needs: 
      ldd /tools/struct_pwa
      
   if you get something like that 
      ...
      libwurstl.so => not found
      libgslw.so.1 => not found
      ...
      
      try 
      -> Add the unresolved library path in /etc/ld.so.conf.d/name-of-lib-x86_64.conf and/or /etc/ld.so.conf.d/name-of-lib-i686.conf
      Reload the library cache (/etc/ld.so.cache) with the command: sudo ldconfig
      or
      -> Add the library path to the environment variable to fix runtime dependency:
      export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:path/to/wurstl/lib:path/to/wurstl/gsl_lib
   
if there is no errors, you can find an executable struct_pwa (structure based pairwise alignment ) in the directory tools to test the library.


to start a test you can tipe something like this:

   cd tools
   ./struct_pwa ../examples/pdb1jjo_1.ent ../examples/pdb1kct.ent ../examples/classfile ../examples/out.pdb -a 0 -r 10.0
   
   general start string is

   ./struct_pwa <pdb1>  <pdb2>  <classFile>  <pdbout>  -a <alg type> -r <rmsd_threshold>
   
Description of input parameters:

   essential fields
   <pdb1> <pdb2> these coordinates will be aligned and superimpossed.
   <classFile> this is an internal file, will be deleted soon
   <pdbout> an output-pdb-file contains new coordinates of <pdb1> (superimposed with <pdb2>)
   
   optional fields
   <alg type> 0 - Nedelman-Wunsch Algorith (global Alignment) (default)
              1 - Smith-Watherman Alg (lockal Alignment)
   <rmsd_threshold> defines how close/good the two proteins should be superimposed. (default 10.0)

   man ./wurstl.1
